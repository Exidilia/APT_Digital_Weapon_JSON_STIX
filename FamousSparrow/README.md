**NAME:**
FamousSparrow

**Description**:
Recently, ESET researchers discovered FamousSparrow, a new cyber espionage group targeting hotels, governments and private companies worldwide. The group has been active since at least 2019, and its victims are mainly hotels around the world, but also governments, international organizations, engineering companies, and law firms in countries such as Brazil, Burkina Faso, South Africa, Canada, Israel, France, and Taiwan, China. The group was also one of the exploiting groups of the Microsoft Exchange ProxyLogon vulnerability that made waves in March this year.

The researchers point to potential links between the FamousSparrow group and other known APT groups. A running Metasploit was found on one of the hosts that researchers FamousSparrow compromised, with a C2 server at cdn.kkxx888666.com, a domain that is associated with the DRBControl threat group.
