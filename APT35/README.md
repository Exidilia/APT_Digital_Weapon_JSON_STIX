**Description**:
APT35, also known as Newscaster Team, is an Iranian government-sponsored threat group that conducts long-term, resource-intensive operations to gather strategic intelligence. APT35 typically targets military, diplomatic and government personnel, media organizations, energy and defense industrial base (DIB), and engineering, business services, and telecommunications sectors in the United States and the Middle East.

APT35 uses fake social media personas to conduct phishing campaigns through its sophisticated social engineering activities. It also exploits the Ekton CMS vulnerability to deliver malicious payloads. The tools it uses include Tunna, ASPXSHELLSV, and PUPYRAT.

Many of the fake personas used by APT35 claim to be part of news organizations, which led to APT35 being called Newscaster Team. In addition, APT35 is believed to overlap with the charming kitten group.

In 2022, the APT35 group exploited the Log4j vulnerability, ProxyShell vulnerability, VMware RCE vulnerability, etc. In 2023, APT35 used .NET binaries and assembly code created in mixed mode to target Israeli entities.
