**NAME:**
Stealth Falcon

**Alias**  
FruityArmor

**Description**:
The Stealth Falcon APT group was discovered and named by the foreign security team Citizen Lab in 2016. The attack activities can be traced back to 2012. Citizen Lab believes that the group is related to the UAE government. Kaspersky named it FruityArmor.
In January 2019, Reuters published an investigation report on Project Raven, saying that the project hired former NSA agents and targeted the same targets as Stealth Falcon. Based on the same goals and attack methods of the two groups, some people believe that Stealth Falcon and Project Raven are the same group.
The Stealth Falcon group mainly carries out spyware attacks on UAE journalists, political activists and dissidents.
The group often uses spear phishing emails and watering hole attacks carrying malicious documents to deliver malware to targets, and uses Windows 0day vulnerabilities many times in attack activities.
