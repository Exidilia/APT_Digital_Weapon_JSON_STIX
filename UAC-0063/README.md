**NAME:**
UAC-0063


**Description**:
The group's earliest attack activities can be traced back to 2021. Suspected to be from Russia, it mainly targets governments, diplomacy, non-governmental organizations, academia, energy and defense in Ukraine, Israel, India and Central Asia, and uses HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY malware to carry out subsequent espionage activities, which has some overlap with APT28.
